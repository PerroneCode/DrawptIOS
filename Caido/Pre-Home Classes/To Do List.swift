// LoginViewController
// UpdatesViewController
// ForgotPasswordViewController

// HomeViewController
// 1) Gradients not working with the first cell
// 2) There seem to be a bug where the Buy Ticket button in the third cell does not change color when pressed

// BrandsAndProductsCollectionViewController
// 1) BUG: When switching from Raffle tab, or Store tab, back to the raffle or store tab, and then scrolling, the app crashes
// 2) Possible fix to 1): Intead of having a collectionView inside of another collectionView, split the brand cells into sections, and each product cell into a cell, so that way its no longer a collectionView inside a collectionView
